Content Page Ideas:

☐ Publish/Unpublish Status: @low
Include a toggle switch or radio buttons to set the post status as either "Published" or "Draft."
This way, posts can be saved without being publicly visible until they are ready.

☐ Preview Feature: @low  //Abandoned! #Not Important!
Add a "Preview Post" button that opens a modal to display the post in the
format it would appear on the main website before publishing.

☐ Save Progress Feature: @high //Done!
Add a "Save Draft" button so that admins can save their progress without publishing the post immediately.
This ensures data isn’t lost if they need more time.

☐ Post Metrics: @low
Display a section that shows post metrics (views, likes, shares) after it’s been published.
This will allow admins to track the engagement of each post.
